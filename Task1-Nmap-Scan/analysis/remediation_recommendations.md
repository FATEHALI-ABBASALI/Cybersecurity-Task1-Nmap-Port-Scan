1. Remediation Recommendations

I. Firewall
   • Maintain strict firewall filtering — since all ports appear filtered, continue enforcing these rules

II. Monitoring
   • Monitor network traffic with IDS/IPS to detect port scanning attempts

III. Vulnerability checks
   • Perform periodic vulnerability scans to validate firewall effectiveness

IV. Service exposure
   • Only allow specific ports/services that are necessary (e.g., web, SSH) and block all others
