III. Results
   • Hosts up: 256
   • Ports: All 1000 common TCP ports on each host were in "filtered" state

IV. Notes
   • Likely firewall/NAT rules blocking port responses
   • No services identified, so attack surface is minimal

V. Risks
   • None visible from this scan, but hidden services may still exist if firewall rules are relaxed
